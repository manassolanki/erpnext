Ready to go live with ERPNext?

So lets be clear,

1. You tried a few cycles in ERPNext
2. You have imported all your records - your model of your organization is complete.
3. You can see the Matrix 🙅

Now lets bring the current "state" of your business into ERPNext. For this you need to do a few more things.

Warning: This might be tricky, and you can always do this later and you might need the help of your accountant to help you with this.

1. Sync up your **Chart of Accounts**
3. Add your opening stock using **Stock Reconciliation**
4. Add your open invoices (both sales and purchase)
3. Add your opening account balances by making a **Journal Entry**

You are now set to go! 🏁 😎
