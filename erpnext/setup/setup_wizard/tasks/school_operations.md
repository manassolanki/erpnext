Unless you have a dedicated team to set this up for you, we recommend using student attendance first! For that you need to create Student Batches and Student Groups. What is the difference?

If all your students in a group have the same set of classes (like in a primary school) then you make batches. If your student in a particular program can select their courses, you need to create a Student Group for each course! 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👨‍👧‍👦
