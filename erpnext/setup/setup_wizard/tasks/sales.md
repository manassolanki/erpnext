ERPNext covers most of what you need to start selling. ðŸ””

Few terms to get familiar with:

1. Potential customers are **Leads**
2. Deals in pipeline are **Opportunities**
3. Proposals sent to customers are **Quotations**
4. Confirmed orders are **Sales Orders**
5. Fulfilment (shipment or completion of services) is **Delivery Note**

The first thing you should probably do is add 5 leads (contact information about prospects who can give you new business). Hint: just type "Lead" in the search bar on the top ðŸ”Ž

Find out if they have any need you can help with and make a few "Opportunities"

Then send them proposals with "Quotation". Did you know, you can email them directly from ERPNext! ðŸ˜Ž

See your sales go up up up! ðŸ“ˆ
