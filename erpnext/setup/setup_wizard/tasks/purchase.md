Already figured out sales? Nice, now lets get to purchasing stuff.

1. First add a few **Suppliers**
2. Find out what you need by making **Material Requests**. Think of them as stickies 🗒 on your refrigerator.
3. Now start placing orders via **Purchase Order**.
4. When your suppliers deliver, make **Purchase Receipts**

Thats it!

If you track inventory on your items, they will automatically be added to your stock.

Now never run out of stock again! 😎
