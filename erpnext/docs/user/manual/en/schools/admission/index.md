# Admission

The Admission section allow you to create the workflow for the online or offline admission process. This includes configuring the online student admission application, receiving online payments and maintaining the application status of each applicant.

The detailed offline and online process is as given below:

##### Online

You can follow the given steps for the online admission:

1. **Create a [Web Form](docs/user/manual/en/website/web-form.html):**
We have already created a standard [Web Form](docs/user/manual/en/website/web-form.html) named "Student Applicant", but if you want your own We you can also create your own [Web Form](docs/user/manual/en/website/web-form.html). You can configure the payment gateway in the [Web Form](docs/user/manual/en/website/web-form.html) itself. Any information filled in the "Student Applicant" Web Form will be saved in the Student Applicant document.

2. **Create Student Admission:**
If you want the online admission, first you have to create a web form for the student applicant. 

##### Offline

You can configure the online payments in the Web Form for the student applicant. Currently we haven't linked the accounts module with each student applicant so you can make bulk Journal Entry for the payments received against the student admission applications.
